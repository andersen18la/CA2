        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            We were tasked with creating a chat system with a client and a server. The system should be able to handle many users at
            once. The service should also be online on one of our servers and should follow a protocol that the teachers
            had provided, so we would be able to test our solution against other groups.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>System Design</h2>
        <p>
            Since the client and server should be deployed separately, we chose to create two java projects.
            <br> Server:
            <br> When the server starts, we bind the Server Socket and execute the MessageHandler in a new thread, which is the class
            that writes to the other clients. We then loop and listens for connections and if someone connects, then
            we create a new ClientHandler, which implements Runnable, and execute it with its own thread, so we are able
            to have more clients at once. If the client follows the protocol and successfully logged in, he is then added
            to an ArrayList with ClientHandlers. If anything is wrong with the client's login protocol or the name is
            taken, we close the connection.
            <br> The ClientHandler is constantly listening for input. If the input is LOGOUT:, then we remove the Client
            from the ArrayList and close the connection. If the client connection dies, we remove him from the list. If the
            client tries to chat and follow the protocol, then we create a new Message, which gets the input value, the
            List of clients and this ClientHandler, as the sender. We then put this Message into an ArrayBlockingQueue located
            in our MessageHandler, which then sends the message, if it followed protocol, to all relevant receivers.
            <br> Each time the ArrayList of Clients are changed, we send a message to all the logged in users.
            <br><br>Client:
            <br>We designed our client with an observer pattern, so that you are able to use it with different GUIs.
        </p>

        <h2>User Manual:</h2>
        <p>
            Download the client <a href="ChatClient.jar">HERE</a> and run it.
            <br>Then in the host you enter jdbh.dk and in the port 8081 and click connect, if you able to connect, then
            the GUI will tell you.
            <br>Then you enter your name into the name square and click login.
            <br>If the name is taken or is not valid then GUI will tell you that the connection is dead.
            <br>Online users are shown in box ontop of the send button.
            <br><br>To write to all on the server, you type your message in the rectangle to the left of send and press
            the send button. Example: "mymessage".
            <br>To send to a private message you type: "nameOfuser:yourmessage"<br>To send a private message to more
            users, then type: "name1,name2:yourmessage".
            <br>Click logout or press the red X in the top to logout.
            <br><br>If the server is down you need to run the ServerInit.class in CA2-Server project.
            <br><br> You can also use telnet and connect to jdbh.dk 8081.
        </p>

        <h2>Test Against Others
        </h2>
        <p>
            All test involves logging in and logging out, sending to all, sending a private message to one clients, and sending a private message to two clients.
        </p>

            Test of our gui against Group 1 server worked.
            They tried to use their gui against ours and it worked.
        </p>

        <img src="peterogrune2.png" alt="runeogpeter test"/>
        <p>
            Test of our GUI against Group 11's server worked somewhat. Their list on the server did not update correctly because of an exception, when the client just closes the connection without logging out.
            Also something was wrong with their gui, so they have not tested their gui with our server.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Group 10 and Group 15 tested our server and said it worked, but we did not have an working GUI at that time, so we did not test their server.
        </p>

        <h2>Who worked on what</h2>
        <p>
            We all worked on the project, and alot of it was done on a single pc, so the commits might not be proportionate with
            the amount of work each group member did.
